## Project Description
  * We all like gaming, and chess is a great game. It has a low skill floor and a very high skill ceiling: each piece is governed by simple rules, but their interactions come together to form a timeless experience with unrivaled depth.
  * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project):
    * C++
    * Git/Github for VCS and productivity management
    * Grid GUI
  * What will be the input/output of your project? What are the features that the project provides?
    * Input: The piece a player would like to use, the program will provide valid positions for that piece to move to
    * Output: The piece will move to the new position, the opponent's chess piece will react appropriately (if taken)
  * Features:
    * Graphical representation of board and pieces
    * Board updates in real time to reflect game-state
    * 2-player support, with potential of a CPU opponent for single-player
    * King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn, all programmed with their appropriate behaviors
